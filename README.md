# Overview

Our group researched [Location and Context APIs](https://developers.google.com/location-context/) on Android. In order to develop proficiency in this area, we focused specifically on the location aspect of it, since it offers the most functionality and is the most commonly implemented in applications.

We created a simple Parking app that is intended to show users their current location, allow them to save the location, and send the location to Google Maps, or copy it to their clipboard. Having your parking spot saved in your phone can make life a lot easier!

The final application will look like this:
